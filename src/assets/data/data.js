    title: "How Akatsuki Business Academia started?",
    desc: "When I look at my past years from this point of view, I wish there was someone who would help me discover my own vision, right before I left for the US, so my return to Georgia would not be just a return, but I would have been able to be much more successful than I am today. I could definitely do this with the 5,000 dollars that I saved after my trip to the US, because, in a developing country like Georgia, 5,000 dollars for a 19-year-old young man with a vision and a business idea can do wonders. You may fail, but the step towards creativity will already be a great success. If there was an organization that would motivate me to return to Georgia and add creativity, I would have used the money I earned much more effectively and thus would have made a much better gift to my current self. However, it was this experience that made me decide that I want to be a contributor to such a discovery in the lives of others. I want the young people who came to America from Georgia and other developing countries not only to come with the interest of new experiences but to return with a certain goal, a business idea, so they will incorporate the Western order, start-up companies, and change everything that the political authorities in these countries are unsuccessfully trying to do. All of this will be invested with the capital earned by their honest work",
